# KXAN Headlines
Another early plugin (2015), **KXAN Headlines** is a WordPress plugin that allows users to display headlines from the KXAN news feed on their WordPress sites. It provides a simple and convenient way to keep visitors informed about the latest news and updates from KXAN, the NBC affiliate in Austin, Texas.

Key features of the plugin include:

  - **Shortcode Integration:** Users can easily add the KXAN headlines to any post, page, or widget on their WordPress site using a shortcode (`[kxan_headlines]`).
  - **Customizable Number of Headlines:** Users have the flexibility to specify the number of headlines they want to display, allowing them to control the amount of content shown on their site (`[kxan_headlines count="10"]`).
  - **Automatic Updates:** The plugin automatically fetches the latest headlines from the KXAN news feed, ensuring that the displayed content is always up to date.
  - **Style Guide:** The plugin comes with a built-in style guide that provides a clean and consistent appearance for the displayed headlines. Users can further customize the appearance by modifying the CSS file provided with the plugin.
  - **Error Handling:** The plugin includes error handling to gracefully handle situations where the KXAN news feed cannot be retrieved. In such cases, an appropriate message is displayed to inform users.
